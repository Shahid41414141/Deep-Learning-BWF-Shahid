A WONDROUS THING,
WHERE MACHINES CAN LEARN,
AND MAKE OUR HEARTS SING.

NEURAL NETWORKS,

FROM IMAGE RECOGNITION,
TO LANGUAGE TRANSLATION,
DEEP LEARNING EXCELS,

IT'S A TOOL FOR PROGRESS,
FOR SCIENCE AND ART,
A WORLD OF POSSIBILITIES,
WITH DEEP LEARNING AT HEART.

SO LET'S CELEBRATE,
THIS TECHNOLOGY BRIGHT,
FOR WITH DEEP LEARNING,
