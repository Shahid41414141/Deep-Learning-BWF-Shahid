deep learning,
a wondrous thing,
where machines can learn,
and make our hearts sing.

neural networks,
layers so deep,
data inputted,
patterns they keep.

from image recognition,
to language translation,
deep learning excels,
in every application.

it's a tool for progress,
for science and art,
a world of possibilities,
with deep learning at heart.

so let's celebrate,
this technology bright,
for with deep learning,
we reach new heights
